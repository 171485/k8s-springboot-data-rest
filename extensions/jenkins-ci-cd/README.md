## Deploy Jenkins CI/CD on AKS and implement a Jenkins *Continous Delivery* pipeline to re-deploy the *po-service* Springboot Java Microservice to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

**Prerequisites:**
1.  Readers are required to complete all hands-on labs in the [parent project](https://github.com/ganrad/k8s-springboot-data-rest) before attempting to work on the hands-on labs in this project.
2.  Readers are required to be familiar with basic Linux commands and are assumed to have prior exposure to deploying application workloads on Linux environments.

**Description:**
In a nutshell, you will work on the following tasks.
1. Implement a Azure DevOps Build and Release Pipeline to deploy Jenkins CI/CD on AKS (Section [A])
   Result: A Jenkins CI/CD cluster (1-executor) deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
2. Implement a Continuous Delivery Pipeline in Jenkins to build and re-deploy *po-service* Springboot Java microservice on AKS (Section [B])
   Result: A **Continuous Delivery** pipeline deployed in Jenkins which will be used to re-deploy the *po-service* microservice on AKS (previously deployed to AKS in the parent project).

**Workflow:**
For easy and quick reference, readers can refer to the following on-line resources as needed.
- [Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/?view=vsts)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/doc/)

### A] Implement Azure DevOps pipelines to deploy Jenkins CI/CD on AKS
